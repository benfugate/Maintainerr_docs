**Maintainerr** makes managing your media easy. No longer do you have to worry about your precious hard drive space being taken up by Movies and TVShows, that aren't even being watched.

> Maintainerr is beta software, please report any bugs and issues.

# Features
- Make Plex collections from a specific set of rules, defined by you.
- Configure those rules to match your needs. (i.e. `Plex last viewed 30 days ago`)
- See an overview of your Plex library contents.
- Manually add an item to one of the above mentioned collections.
- Manually exclude an item from one of the collections, even if it meets the rule criteria.
- Show your new collection on the *Plex Home* screen.
- Set a number of days the collection will exist before it is deleted.
- Set Radarr and Sonarr to either **remove** or **unmonitor** media in the collection.
- Auto clear requests from Overseerr
- Remove media from disk

Currently, Maintainerr supports rules across these apps :

- Plex
- Overseerr
- Radarr
- Sonarr

## Motivation

I've been sharing my Plex Server with family and friends for a while now. They quickly started to request everything they could think of through Overseerr, while not watching most of it. Since I use a modest server with limited capacity, I had to spend some time cleaning up after them.

With Maintainerr, I no longer have to keep an eye on their usage. And it has the added benefit of announcing media that's about to be deleted on the Plex home screen.
