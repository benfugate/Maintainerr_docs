<b>Maintainerr</b> makes managing your media easy. Create custom rules with parameters across different services, show the matching media on the Plex home screen for a given amount of days and handle the deletion.

> Maintainerr is beta software, please report any bugs and issues.

# Features
- Configure rules specific to your needs
- Manually add media to a collection, in case it's not included in your rules
- Exclude  media for some or all rules
- Show a plex collection, containing selected media, on the Plex home screen for a specific duration
- Remove or unmonitor media from Radarr
- Remove or unmonitor media from Sonarr
- Clear requests from Overseerr
- Remove media from disk

Currently, Maintainerr supports rules across these apps :

- Plex
- Overseerr
- Radarr
- Sonarr

# Motivation

I've been sharing my Plex Server with family and friends for a while now. They quickly started to request everything they could think of through Overseerr, while not watching most of it. Since I use a modest server with limited capacity, I had to spend some time cleaning up after them.

With Maintainerr, i no longer have to keep an eye on their usage. And it has the added benefit of announcing media that's about to be deleted on the Plex home screen.
